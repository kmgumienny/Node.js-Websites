# Yeat

http://yeat.herokuapp.com/

We have designed "Yeat", a web application for sharing left-over food/networking. This app serves a smaller community, specifically college students on and off campus. This exhibits an exemplary practice in reducing the amount of food waste, as well as creating a chance for people to come together and network. In this application, people will have the chance to create an "event" to share food, which consists of a description/type of the left-over food, the date and time, location and max capacity of people. They can also "request" to attend an event posted by other people. Locations are hidden unless you are accepted to the event or that is your own event. This alleviates the possibility of an entire class coming to your place!

## The logical flow of this website: 

- Register for a new account (or log in if you already have one). 
- You are redirected to a main page where all the events are stored. 
  + There are 4 types of events: events owned by yourself, events you applied for, events you are accepted for, and all other events. 
- Press plus button to create a new one
- Create a new event by filling out all the required fields. You will be brought back to the event page when you are done
- Use the search bar to find a specific event more easily.
- Click on the image to change your profile pic.
- Click on the Bio and Favorite to update description about you and your favorite type of food.
- Check out the different types of events pressing the buttons on the right panel.
- Request to join an event. Wait for response
- If someone requests to join your event, you can decide to either accept or decline.
  + Click on the name to see a person's information 
- Log out of your account (optional)
