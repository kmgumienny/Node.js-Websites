## Technical Achievements
- **Added Images**: Found images I wanted to include on my webpage and edited server.js to include them in my webpage.
- **Used CSS elements**: Instead of only using html to create a website purely of text, I incorporated CSS to help style the webpage.
- **Added a styles.css sheet**: Instead of defining all the different attributes I wanted my elements to have in their tags manually, I defined styles in a separate .css document that index.html references.
- **Added a button to link to Github**: There is a button on my page that redirects the user in a new tab to my github account.

### Design Achievements
- **Cantered 4 Images inline**: 4 images are centered on the webpage in an inline box and scale with the size of the browser.
- **Included scalable background**: There is a background on my webpage that scales with the size of the browser.
- **Image overlay slide when hovering**: By hovering over the 4 inline images previously mentioned, text comes up and explains their significance. Once the user moves their mouse away, the text hovers down again.
- **Created Skills Bar**: Combined 2 skill bars together, one to show the name of the programming language and another to show my confidence percentage in that language to create one large skill bar showcasing my programming knowledge.
- **Created Dropdown Button**: Created a dropdown button that displays computer science classes I've taken. They do not hyperlink to anything.
