The goal of our project was to create an ecommerce site that focused specifically on seltzer water. There are no dedicated websites dedicated to bringing the best prices and the best experiences when shopping for sparkling water. We built a node application running that combines a frontend with a bright design, a javascript backend, and a mongodb to deliver the complete seltzer water buying experience. By doing so we learned how to use multiple new node frameworks and developed a backend code that is more easy to navigate. Our ecommerce site encapsultaes everything we learned in class.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Changed from using vanilla javascript to host the HTTP server to using Express
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Designed Routes when a request is made that there are seperate js files responding to requests based on where the request was made 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Used express-handlebars to dynamically load content into the web page so that it is rendered based on information on users in the database
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Made use of cookies and sessions to maintain user sessions while they are connected to the website.
- **Tech Achievement 5**: Used jQuery to traverse DOM trees and get elements that would have been significantly harder to get not using the framework
- **Tech Achievement 6**: Implemented fixed position html elements so when the user scrolls through the seltzer selection, the fized elements, such as the cart, remain on the screen.
- **Tech Achievement 7**: Allowed user to change their password with extra validation

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Separated initilaization javascript code including the connection to the database to a seperate file to maintain clean code 
- **Design Achievement 2**: When an item is out of stock it can not be purchased and the button changes to an unclickable one
- **Design Achievement 3**: When an item is clicked to be purchased but the user does not log in, a popup displays to indicate we would like them to create an account before taking away allocated stock
- **Design Achievement 4**: Used modals from bootstrap when someone is logging in to show the display instead of taking them to a seperate page
- **Design Achievement 5**: Styled the page with CSS to make all elements match and to help the UX.
- **Design Achievement 6**: Utilized fontAwesome icons to be used as way to navigate the website. They are better and more space-efficient when compared to just clicking long links or names.
